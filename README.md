## Goal:

Create a jQuery plugin that we can include on any web page on the internet, which turns random words on the page into clickable links. This is very similar to our InText product, but we'd like to see how you'd go about building one yourself from scratch :-)

*What we're looking for:*

- Code readability
- Performance (dom traversal, replacement, etc)
- Obfuscation (we'll compile your code using UglifyJS and look at the output to see if we can identify from the compiled code how it works)
- Over-the-wire bandwidth (your code should be as lightweight as possible .. we'll just the compiled code size, not the original)
- Modern usage of jQuery for cross-browser compatibility (chrome, firefox, and ie8 would be nice)

*Bonus points:*

If you add some easter eggs :-)
