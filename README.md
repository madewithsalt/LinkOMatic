## Installation

You can load this up as a Chrome extension to see it in action.

- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Make sure "Developer Mode" is checked
- Select the `src` folder when choosing the unpacked folder

## Uglifying

You can also use grunt (included) to uglify the plugin script:

1. `npm install`
2. `grunt`

## Thanks! :)
